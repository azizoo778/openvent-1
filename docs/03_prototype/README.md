## Prototypes

Currently, we have the following prototypes developed and documented:

* [Latest](./bagValveMaskProto3rd.md)
* [Second Prototype](./bagValveMaskProto2nd.md)
* [First Prototype](./bagValveMaskProto1st.md)

The latest prototype becomes part of the history once a new one is started or has been finished.\
Feel free to contribute here by forking our repository and start developing.\
Please check the [development workflow](../08_development/README.md) for more details and how to collaborate plus contribute here.

If you find issues or something is unclear, feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/mhollfelder/openvent/issues).

## Documentation

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhollfelder/openvent/assets/docs/assets/prototypes/v1_prototypes_technical_drawing_overview.jpeg" width="500px">

The prototypes typically consist of the following elements as part of this repository:

* Mechanics
* Software
* Hardware
* Documentation

The documentation here plus the overview of the prototypes is the first source for prototype specific information.\
The `concept` documentation and the respective `mechanics`, `software`, and `hardware` parts of the documentation hold the respective documentation valid on an abstracter level as the prototypes are.
